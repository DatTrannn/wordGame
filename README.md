# wordGame

This is a word matter application that ask user to place the character boxes in order to make the word meaningful. The app will count the time user could solve the word and then check whether it is the best score. There is also a setting function for user to justify the phone brightness to see the display clearer. There are 4 screens: CheckScore, MainActivity, Setting and StartGame.
